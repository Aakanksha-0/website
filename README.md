Set of tools to make COD7 more useful for conference planning.

In particular, the additions are aimed at making versions alpha2 and higher easier to use. COD 7alpha2 is the line that integrates OG, which brings with it both more powerful functionality, at the cost of some development pain. This module aims to bridge that gap.

Originally developed for NYC Camp website (http://nyccamp.org) with the intent of releasing back to COD community.

NB: Since NYC Camp is a 100% free event, initial Codify tools do not address paid registration issues. 

@TODO- Featurize session grid views.
